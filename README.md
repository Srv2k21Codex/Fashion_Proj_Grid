# Responsive Grid Layout Project

## Main Functionality

This project demonstrates a responsive web layout using a grid-based system. The layout is designed to adapt to different screen sizes, providing an organized and visually appealing interface. The key features include:

- **Flexible Grid Layout**: Utilizes CSS Grid to structure the page into multiple sections that adjust based on screen size.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures the layout is functional and aesthetically pleasing on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Dynamic Content**: Includes a video element and a navigation menu that adjusts its display on smaller screens.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Defines the structure and content of the web page.
- **CSS**: Styles the page layout, including grid configuration and responsive design adjustments.
  - **CSS Grid**: For creating a flexible and organized layout.
  - **Media Queries**: For adapting the layout to different screen sizes.
  - **Transformations**: Applied to elements for visual effects.

## How It Works

1. **Grid Layout**: The page is divided into multiple sections using CSS Grid, allowing for a responsive design that adjusts to different screen sizes.
2. **Responsive Adjustments**: Media queries adjust the layout and styling for mobile devices, ensuring that content remains accessible and well-organized.
3. **Video and Navigation**: A video element is used for dynamic content, and a navigation menu adapts to smaller screens with modified visibility.

## Usage

To view the layout, clone the repository and open the `index.html` file in a web browser. Modify the `style.css` file to customize the appearance and layout according to your needs.
